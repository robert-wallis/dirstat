# dirstat a cli directory information tool
```
$ dirstat
 directory: 71
      file: 109
```

# Goals
* quickly get simple stats about what's taking space in the folder

# Non-Goals
* become a DSL like `awk`, dirstat should get theoretically 80% of what an average user needs, more than that they should write their own script or tool
